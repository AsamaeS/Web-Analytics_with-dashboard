# Specification: Decision Intelligence Platform Dashboard
**Role**: Senior Product Designer & Data Architect
**Context**: Executive-level strategic analysis for unstructured NoSQL data.

---

## 1. Visual Identity & Layout Strategy
**Design Philosophy**: Microsoft Fluent Design (Azure Intelligence style). 
- **Palette**: "Azure Professional" - Slate grays (`#252526`), deep blues (`#0078D4`), and "Signal Mint" (`#22C55E`) for trends.
- **Atmosphere**: Dark Mode by default to reduce cognitive load; high-contrast typography (Segoe UI/Inter).
- **Layout Architecture**: 
  - **Global Command Bar**: Top horizontal bar for global states.
  - **Discovery Rail**: Left-side vertical panel for project configuration.
  - **Intelligence Canvas**: Main central area (Grid-based).
  - **Assistant Sidecar**: Right-side collapsible panel for LLM-driven insights.

## 2. Component Specifications

### 2.1 Project Configuration Layer (The Discovery Rail)
*Located in the left sidebar.*
- **Project Selector**: A vertical column of high-quality icons representing current domains (e.g., Hospital icon for Healthcare, Shield for Finance).
- **Metadata Card**:
  - **Project Name & Domain**: Bold typography.
  - **Active Keywords**: A cloud of "Chip" components (removable/addable).
  - **Volume Badge**: A real-time counter of total documents analyzed (e.g., "1.2M Docs").
- **Time Pulse**: A simplified range selector (Last 24h, 7d, 30d, Custom).

### 2.2 Core Analytical Visualizations (The Intelligence Canvas)
*Focus: Detecting "What" and "When".*
- **A. Temporal Narrative Evolution**:
  - **Type**: Stacked Area Chart.
  - **Purpose**: Visualizes how topic volume ebbs and flows.
  - **Feature**: Vertical "Signal Markers" (vertical dotted lines) indicating peak events.
- **B. Topical Heatmap**:
  - **Type**: 2D Grid (X: Time, Y: Themes).
  - **Purpose**: Detect correlation between themes (e.g., in Healthcare, when "Regulation" and "Privacy" both glow red simultaneously).
- **C. Source Dominance Map**:
  - **Type**: Circular Pack or Bubble Chart.
  - **Purpose**: Area size = Document volume; Color saturation = Authority/Sentiment value.
- **D. Anomaly Detection (Signal Radar)**:
  - **Type**: Line chart with "Outlier Glow".
  - **Purpose**: Automated alerts for volume spikes exceeding 2 standard deviations from the moving average.

### 2.3 Semantic Analysis Section
*Focus: Detecting "How" and "Why".*
- **Concept Clustering Map**:
  - **Type**: Force-Directed Graph.
  - **Purpose**: Shows concepts that frequently appear together. Clusters represent "Sub-narratives".
  - **Interaction**: Clicking a cluster updates the Global Filter to those specific concepts.
- **Narrative Drift**:
  - **Type**: Streamgraph.
  - **Purpose**: Tracks how a story changes. (e.g., from "Initial Outbreak" to "Vaccine Development" to "Policy Debate").

### 2.4 LLM-powered Decision Assistant (The Sidecar)
*Focus: "So What?". Grounded ONLY in the NoSQL database.*
- **Executive TL;DR**: An auto-refreshing markdown card summarizing the current filtered view.
  - *Format*: "Current trend indicates a 15% rise in [Theme X], largely driven by [Source Y]. Strategic Risk: High."
- **Decision Q&A**: A chat interface where users ask: "Which sources are most critical of the new policy?"
  - **Traceability**: Each LLM answer includes clickable "Source links" (footnotes) pointing to the raw NoSQL documents.
- **Scenario Horizon**:
  - *Example*: "If [Topic A] continues this growth, it will likely intersect with [Regulatory Trend B] by Q3."

## 3. Interaction Logic (Decision Flow)

1.  **Global Synchronization**: Changing the **Time Pulse** or **Project Selector** triggers an `onStateChange` event that re-fetches data for all charts and the LLM's prompt context.
2.  **Cross-Filtering**: Clicking a "Spike" in the **Temporal Evolution Chart** automatically filters the **Concept Cluster Map** to show only keywords from that specific time slice.
3.  **LLM Prompt Injection**: When a user selects a specific anomaly or cluster, the dashboard silently injects this context into the LLM's system message: *"User is currently focused on the Anomaly detected on Oct 12th. Ground your next answer in documents from that period."*
4.  **Explainability**: Every insight generated by the AI has a "Show Data" button that highlights the specific charts/clusters that led to that conclusion.

## 4. Implementation Guide (2-Day Sprint)

| Layer | Tooling Recommendation | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | Streamlit or Vite + React | Streamlit is fastest for student POCs. |
| **Charts** | Chart.js (Timeline) / D3.js (Clusters) | Use `react-chartjs-2` for easy integration. |
| **Logic** | Python FastAPI / Node.js | Simple GET endpoints for NoSQL aggregation. |
| **LLM** | OpenAI API / LangChain | Use System Prompts for "Database Grounding". |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Executive Summary for Students**: Focus on the **LLM Integration + Temporal Chart** first. These provide 80% of the value for decision-makers. The complex Clustering can be simplified to a "Top 10 Keywords" bar chart if time is tight.
